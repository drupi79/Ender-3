# Ender 3 Klipper Config and Associated files
Repository of my Ender 3  Klipper Files


I have spent a fair amount of time converting my heavily modified Ender 3 with a BigTreeTech SKR Mini E3 V3.0 Mainboard to Klipper. After many revisions and significant hardware changes, these are my current working config files.

I followed Ellis’ Print Tuning Guide once I had the printer running to tune my printer. I’d suggest if you have never done a Klipper Conversion before follow that tuning guide to the letter. It hasn’t failed me yet across multiple printers to get it dialed in 90% and then do small changes to get it perfect.

Some things to note:

• I replaced my bed springs with ABS Solid Bed Mounts. I suggest using the Screws Tilt Calculate command to level your own bed.

• Installed KAMP. Some things are still commented out as I haven't had a chance to adapt my printer to it yet.

• Creality Spider v3 hotend installed with upgraded heater. 

• Make sure you go through your printer and tighten everything down before running any input shaping. You could shake everything loose and lose your bed level or have something fall off.

• I did leave all of my PID tuning, heightmap, input shaping, and z-offset in the config as this is also my backup for my own printer so be sure to remove and adjust it for your own use. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU MESSING UP YOUR OWN PRINTER.

I don’t provide support anywhere actively. That being said I do help with others on r/3dprinting, r/klipper, and r/Ender3 on Reddit when I have time. you can also find me on TikTok!
